<h4>What support do you offer?</h4>

I offer support by email. I usually answer emails within 24 hours but often I will get back to you a lot faster.

<h4>What types of payment do you accept?</h4>

Payments are made using PayPal , credit or debit card or Bank Transfer.

<h4>Can I change my plan later?</h4>

Sure. You can upgrade or downgrade your plan at any time. The new plan will be available instantly.

<h4>Are there any setup fees or long term contracts?</h4>

Nope. Intralist is a month to month service, giving you the flexibility to downgrade, upgrade or cancel at any time. While refunds are not offered for past payments, if you downgrade or cancel you will -not- be billed again.

<h4>How does the 30 day guarantee work?</h4>

I am confident that you will love Intralist. If for any reason you decide that Intralist is not right for you after 30 days, just get in touch and I will provide a full refund for the first month.

<div class="question"><span>Are there any fees or contracts?</span></div>
	<div class="answer"> <p>No fees and no contracts.  You can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel at any time with no questions asked.</p></div>
	
	<div class="question"><span>Do I need to buy a separate license for each person in my company?</span></div>
	<div class="answer"> <p>No. The paid plans all include unlimited users, so you'd need to purchase only one account for your company.</p></div>
	
	<div class="question"><span>What forms of payment do you accept?</span></div>
	<div class="answer"> <p>We accept Mastercard, Visa, American Express, and Discover.</p></div>
	
	<div class="question"><span>What browsers do you support?</span></div>
	<div class="answer"> <p>Mockingbird officially supports the latest versions of Chrome, Safari, and Firefox.  You may be able to get Mockingbird to run in earlier versions of these browsers or in other browsers, but we don't actively develop and test for them.</p></div>
	
	<div class="question"><span>Is my data secure?</span></div>
	<div class="answer"> <p>Definitely.  All plans come with SSL encryption and you can set fine-grained permissions per project to make sure only the people you want see what you make.</p>
<p>Your data is hosted with Linode and backed up to two different locations, both of which store your data with high redundancy.</p></div>
